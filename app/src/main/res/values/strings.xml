        Dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i> ) is a common meadow herb of the <i>Asteraceae</i> or sunflower family.There are about 100
        species of dandelion, and all are beneficial. This sun-loving beauty is a native of Greece,
        naturalized in temperate regions throughout the world, and familiar to nearly everyone.
        The perennial dandelion grows freely wherever it can find a bit of earth and a place
        in the sun. Dandelion\'s nutritive and medicinal qualities have been known for centuries.

        The Rose family is especially abundant in E Asia, Europe, and North America, where species of almost
        half of the family\'s genera are indigenous, especially in the
        Pacific coastal area. Many of the <i>Rosaceae</i> are thorny, and most are characterized
        by the presence of stipules on the leaf, by flowers having five sets of parts,
        by a fleshy fruit, such as a rose hip or an apple, that is derived in large part from a
        cup-shaped enlargement of the flower stalk, and by the near absence of endosperm in the seed.
